      General utilities I've found useful as I go about my day-to-day work. Particular highlights include;
      Extensions.EnumExtensions : "Modifiable" description attributes with parsing from descriptions to associated enum value.
      Extensions.DateTimeExtensions : Neat little &lt;DateTime var&gt;.Within to find if the DT was within the last X seconds/days/etc
      Extensions.StringExtensions: To &amp; from Comma Separated Lists and extract text from within specified "marker strings".
      Config.Settings: Typed reading from and writing default values to the .config or .json file.
      Exceptions.ReasonedExceptionT: Base class for my exception pattern that accompanies an exception with an enum reason where the description attribute provides both the (formattable) message and intellisense. This leads to a centralised list of all possible exception reasons and messages.
      Database.TransactedConnection : Handles nested transactions/connections.
      Validation : A number of additional validation attributes including ListContent, Child/Parent, NonDefault
