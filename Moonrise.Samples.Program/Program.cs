//// This is a standard .Net JSON settings file. You COULD process it using the standard .Net core way of 
//// reading it - can't remember what that is as it's ages since I used that. I do remember that it relies
//// on injecting a settings handler. The problem I have with that is that you have to keep injecting the appropriate
//// reference and accepting it etc. Same thing with logging, in fact for logging it's much worse. Why?
//// Well settings you generally only read during some startup phase, whereas logging you want to be able to use EVERYWHERE
//// and I for one do NOT want to keep injecting logger references to every single class that I might want to log from!
//// I explain more in the Samples code. The other advantage of the Moonrise Settings is "hydrating" complete object
//// trees. Again see the example for more details!
