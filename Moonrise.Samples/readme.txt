//
// NOTE: Moonrise.Samples is code to show examples of using the Moonrise nuget packages. You used to be able to bundle content files into nuget packages
// and have them added to the consuming project. Those days are over for so-called "SDK Projects", i.e. .Net Core as opposed to .Net Framework.
// HOWEVER, you CAN still include a readme.txt that the nuget package manager will show you when you first install a package.
//
// There are two files contained within this readme.txt
// 1. The sample code. The various classes are all in one "file" for ease of distribution like this.
// 2. A sample application settings file in JSON format. The sample assumes it's called "Moonrise.Samples.appSettings.json"
//    and "informs" the Moonrise Settings class of the name. The default is to assume it's called "appSettings.json"
// 
// PLEASE read the comments in the sample "program" and if you look in your local nuget cache - usually found under [User folder]\.nuget\packages -
// you will find in the Moonrise.Samples folder that there is a Moonrise.chm help file which is a good reference.
//
// FINALLY, if there is an update to this Moonrise.Samples package, then please upgrade by uninstalling before re-installing the new version
// as this way you guarantee that this readme.txt will be redisplayed with, of course, the updated sample code!
// 
// P.S. I'm using .tt/T4 templates to include the code and settings from the actual code & settings file. It's great, saves me having to copy & paste
// manually into a readme!
//
// Okay, off we go. Cut the content between the +++ & --- comments into Moonrise.Samples.cs and call Moonrise.Samples.Run(); from your console app main

// This is a standard .Net JSON settings file. You COULD process it using the standard .Net core way of 
// reading it - can't remember what that is as it's ages since I used that. I do remember that it relies
// on injecting a settings handler. The problem I have with that is that you have to keep injecting the appropriate
// reference and accepting it etc. Same thing with logging, in fact for logging it's much worse. Why?
// Well settings you generally only read during some startup phase, whereas logging you want to be able to use EVERYWHERE
// and I for one do NOT want to keep injecting logger references to every single class that I might want to log from!
